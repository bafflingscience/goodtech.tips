## More Boobs, less Politics
{{< giphy PcFOvGTtegeEMAyRAO >}}
Everybody loves em'
Can the internet save me?

What have I become?

Is my worst crime allowing this cruel world to defeat me so lopsidedly?

I have become afraid to share anything personal.
I have lived in fear of my daughter's mother for 10 years. 
I have collapsed into a depression/time-warp/alternate-reality
The election didn't help preserve what was left of my mind.

I have gone crazy and have lost my job because i cannot. I have completely given up. I just want to go lay in the street and just lay there.


Also, a page of [NSWF](../../boobs+/) breast pictures. I like to look at them because they make me less sad.

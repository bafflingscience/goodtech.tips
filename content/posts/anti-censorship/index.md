## The Fix is In

In a coordinated attack on Parler, the largest free speech social network has been removed by [Apple](https://nlpc.org/2020/12/30/report-uighur-slaves-forced-to-work-in-apple-suppliers-factory/) from the App Store. Then Google banned them from the Google Play Store. But people were still using Parler on the web. So they cut them off at the source, and Amazon pulled their servers. 


This action by Amazon means that Parler is coming down until they can build their own servers because everyone is beholden to the Tech Lords, and don't dare being crushed by Iron Fist.

Earlier in 2020, [Epik], who provided hosting to BitChute and Gab was taken down for similar reasons. 

It had gained over one million users since Trump's social media bans began.

The list of tech platforms who, this week, have banned The President of The United States
- Twitter
- Facebook
- Instagram
- Reddit
- Snapchat
- Pinterest
- TikTok
- YouTube
- Twitch
- Spotify

Really, Spotify??

## SILENCE THE HEATHENS!
And now, one a company that I thought I could count on to stand on the right side, Mozilla, have released a statement calling for more censorship due to the danger of violent white supremecists, titled [We need more than deplatforming](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2021/01/08/we-need-more-than-deplatforming/). 


Was it white supremicists burning down cities all over the country in 2020? No, it was BLM and Antifa. In fact, there is at least one verified BLM and Antifa activist named John Sullivan, who was captured on video stating "We need to burn this place down.", while inside the Capital Building on Jan. 6.

There is was no outrage at the chaos and violence during the "mostly peaceful" riots by BLM and Antifa. There was no imminent danger when When multitudes of [people were killed during the George Floyd Riots](https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/tyler-o-neil/2020/07/05/say-their-names-20-people-killed-in-the-george-floyd-riots-n592577).


The non-chalance with which these companies are quelling free speech is disturbing.

They are trying to prevent the opposition from communicating with each other.
We cannot continue supporting YouTube, Twitter or Facebook.
 
Twitter is able to facilitate the dissemination of CPP (Chinese Communist Party) Propaganda, bury stories about Joe Biden based on nothing, and prevent the President of The United States from speaking directly to the American people, but Parler is the danger.

Here is a list of currently available Conservative News Outlets and Alternative Social Media platforms.

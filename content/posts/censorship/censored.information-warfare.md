## The Fix is In

In a coordinated attack on Parler, the largest free speech social network has been removed by [Apple](https://nlpc.org/2020/12/30/report-uighur-slaves-forced-to-work-in-apple-suppliers-factory/) from the App Store. Then Google banned them from the Google Play Store. But people were still using Parler on the web. So they cut them off at the source, and Amazon pulled their servers. 

It had gained over one million users since Trump's social media bans began.

## SILENCE THE HEATHENS!
Even a company that I thought I could count on, Mozilla, has released a statement calling for more censorship due to the danger of violent white supremacists, titled [We need more than deplatforming](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2021/01/08/we-need-more-than-deplatforming/). 
Hey Mozilla, Go Fuck Yourself.

Was it white supremacists burning down cities all over the country in 2020? No, it was BLM and Antifa. In fact, there is at least one verified BLM and Antifa activist named John Sullivan, who was captured on video stating "We need to burn this place down.", while inside the Capital Building on Jan. 6.

There was no outrage at the chaos and violence during the "mostly peaceful" riots by all year. There was no imminent danger when When nearly 50 [people were killed during the George Floyd Riots](https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/tyler-o-neil/2020/07/05/say-their-names-20-people-killed-in-the-george-floyd-riots-n592577).


The ease with which these companies are silencing free speech is disturbing.

They are trying to prevent the opposition from communicating with each other.
 
Twitter is able to facilitate the dissemination of CPP (Chinese Communist Party) Propaganda, bury stories about Joe Biden based on nothing, and prevent the President of The United States from speaking directly to the American people, but Parler is the danger.

Here is a list of Conservative News Outlets and Alternative Social Media platforms.

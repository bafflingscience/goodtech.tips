​	As I type this, there are anywhere from 40 to 4000 tabs open in three browsers on my desktop. I use Google Chrome for SEO and SERPs, keyword research, and running Google's Lighthouse audits from the Dev Tools on my website. I use the Brave Browser for interfacing with Google's Web Marketing Platform, and I use Firefox for YouTube, GitHub, web development searches and whatever else it is I do all day on the computer.

​	But today's focus is not on my prolific use of browsers, but on  the sprawling sitemap that gives the web crawling bots a reason the crawl. world of services offered by Google, and how the tools available to help even the most poverty stricken internet connected individuals out there. Believe me, I know. The tools available for the price of free, will guide you to understanding what people want, how you can give it to them, and how to make money giving people something they want. It seems so simple when you break it down, and for some it is, but alas, I have never known the good graces of the dollar bill. In fact, if I were a more suspicious man, I might think that I was part of some elaborate conspiracy, with some cartoonish caricature of a capitalist in a stovepipe hat dangling dollars just out of my reach, like a carrot on a string, either for profit or kicks, to keep me racing along.

side note, here is one of the interesting things I do all day on the internet in the Firefox Browser.

​	I have no doubt that any competent person who simply follows the best practices, keeps reading, and doesn't have debilitating adhd squirrel brain (like someone I know), will make a handsome sum of money.

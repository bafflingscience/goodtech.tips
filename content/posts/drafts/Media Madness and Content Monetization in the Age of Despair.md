I lost my mind during the 2020 election. 

It started a while back and hit maximum fever pitch the night of the election. That's when I began lurking on Twitter. Every day there were new reports of voter fraud. Everyday the media was covering it up and feeding misinformation. Dominion Election Software and Eric "Antifa" Coomer, 'is Coomer a real name, that has to be a PsyOp" I thought to myself. I discovered a video where Coomer was buried thirty minutes in, his colleague was speaking highly of him and said that he Coomer couldn't there because he was in Serbia setting up election software. It was 2016. "Oh my, this is big" I thought.  Then I went back on Twitter, there were Dominion manuals, graphs, charts and eye witness accounts. Then there was The Kraken.

I took screenshots of everything. I was connecting the dots man! The truth is being revealed. The deep state is being uncovered.  I made a mind map, 'The Conspiracy of Everything' I called it. Burisma, The Clinton Foundation, Fusion GPS, Jeffrey Epstein, PedoGate, PizzaGate, Ukraine, China, Russia, WHO, Build Back Better, George Soros, BLM, Antifa, Rockefellers, FBI, CIA, Obama, Kennedy, UN, CHINA, Covid-19 Bio Warfare, Stuxnet, Cyber Espionage, etc. That's only the tip of the iceberg. But, the free trial for my mind map software expired. Then I lost my mind while making mind maps and obsessing over the election and The Conspiracy of Everything, then I lost my job.

Now I'm screwed. shit. 



I'm trying to figure out how money works. But I'm tired right now. I'll get to that in: Part II  - - - b o o b . c i t y . U S A  

In the meantime, I made a website for the purpose of improving my chances of scoring a tech job of some kind or another. Right now it's just some notes I've taken on things like terminal commands and developer tools; dressed up like a blog.

Ok then.

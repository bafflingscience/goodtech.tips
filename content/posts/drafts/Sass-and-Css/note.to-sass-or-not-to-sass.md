# I destroyed my website

## @use SASS or DIE!

​	I have not used Sass or SCSS in a long time prior to today. And I completely forgot what the hell I was doing. It may have had something to do with the chaos of trying to rebuild my website after having inexplicably removed half of the content, committed a large number of unrelated documents, and proceeded to push this garbage heap of ADHD incarnate to GitHub. I was somehow able to save the correct build from destruction through Netlify, don't ask how. I have no idea wtf happened or by whom I was possessed when all this happened. I was able to heroically save my shitty website from the Invisible Chaos Monster who has been out to destroy me for as long as I can remember. 

​	Now, when I realized what God had just done to me, I immediately disconnected the GitHub repo from the  automatic builds on Netlify. I found one decent build in the middle of eight others that were total shit. So fresh. I'll just download the .zip I thought, what could go wrong!? 

​	Well, that shit didn't work. I tried on Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Safari, Opera, Edge, and you bet your ass I threw Microsoft Explorer into the ring for one last chance at glory..of course it didn't work. This ain't Rudy! 

​	But I am unable to download the zip file of the current deployment of the site from the Netlify Deploy Build page. But I didn't get to where I am today by doing things the right way. So instead of contacting Netlify Support, I decided to go on a terrible adventure against myself for nobody's benefit but the God's of Grief.

​	I had to get down and dirty on this one. I used `wget -m davidclegg.dev` to download the website onto my computer. This gave me enough to work with, I could now torcher myself for the remainder of the day.....

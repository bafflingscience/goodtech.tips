summary: "I have ways of making money of which you know nothing"
---
As a master of finance and speculation, my brain is obviously quite large. Having seen more than 25 MMA fights, I am a beast in the octagon. I make moves that make money. The proof is in the pudding. Do I drive a nice car? Figure it out. Is my wife beautiful? You bet. When do I travel? Whenever I want. Life is good for a confident alpha male with a huge dick and an even bigger check book.

I am like an amplified, more muscular version of John D Rockefeller, who said

*"I believe that the power to make money is a gift from God."*

Another Rockefeller gem, and something I say to nosy bastards who ask too many questions, 

*"I have ways of making money of which you know nothing."*

## Computering the Game
Moving on, the rules are simple.
The game is success, whoever reaches it, wins.

play includes 
- time
- money
- decisions
- chaos

Success is the game you're playin', time is money, and money is time. Every single last word is important when you start writing billions of lines of code like I do every single day.

Working long into the night, even on Thursdays, after dinner with Mother.

Where are we? In the realm of the computers of course. 

Computering is all about making difficult things easier. It's a dance with the machine. When you dance, it is about the rhythm  is faster better? Not always my dear fellow.

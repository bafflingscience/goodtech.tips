## Computering the Game
Moving on, the rules are simple.
The game is success, whoever reaches it, wins.

play includes 
- time
- money
- decisions
- chaos

Success is the game you're playin', time is money, and money is time. Every single last word is important when you start writing billions of lines of code like I do every single day.

Working long into the night, even on Thursdays, after dinner with Mother.

Where are we? In the realm of the computers of course.

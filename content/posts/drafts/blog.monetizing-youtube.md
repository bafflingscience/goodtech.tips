### Step Five - Getting the Music
YouTubes Audio Library is pretty amazing. It's all free music for you to use in your videos, yes you can monetize. Some have a license type that will require you to provide attribution to the artist, but that's not much to ask for the free music.

You can filter by Mood, Genre, Artist, and Attribution Required. In addition, you can sort by Track Title, Duration, Date Added.

I am trying to find royalty free creative commons, commercial re-use ok, Mozart music
I have been finding lots of licensing libraries that require payment before downloading anything.
We're shooting for a free setup, so that won't work.
I went to YouTube and searched 'free royalty free mozart' and found a channel call [CBGP Music] that seems to have what I'm looking for. They have a playlist titled 'Classical Musopen Songs - Public Domain Music', which I will download using a `youtube-dl` script I've already written for playlists that will download all the videos and put them into a folder with the name of the playlist. But I just need the audio for these, so I'm going to modify the script because I haven't created that downloads the audio only. For more on `youtube-dl`, check out my blog all about it (still uploading, but it's coming).



#### Getting the Videos
I signed up at https://pexels.com where you can download free stock videos to use for your YouTube channel


### Step Six - Creating the Video
I'm using the free Windows App FilmForth that I found in the Windows Store


### Things I Noticed While Doing This
The channel Yellow Brick Cinema - Relaxing Music, has Live Streams of music playing at all times, 22 at this moment.

Put ads at beginning and end of focus music videos

I wonder how that works, it seems a good approach.

- High CPM(Click Per Mille) Keywords

Cost per thousand (CPM), also called cost per mille, is a marketing term used to denote the price of 1,000 advertisement impressions on one web page. If a website publisher charges $2.00 CPM, that means an advertiser must pay $2.00 for every 1,000 impressions of its ad.

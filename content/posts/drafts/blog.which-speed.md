***"We must go faster"***

**they** say 

But who are **they**?

what do I care if **they** say **things** that **way**?

If I choose to go slower you have somethin' to say?

Very well, I'm going to pontificate in a most bodacious way.

***"Why are we going faster?***
 
where? 
why? 
for whom? 
upon whose behest? 



What if I like slow speed the best?
My preference for speed is a simple request.

I like **things** in a particular **way** like **just so** 

and of **all** two **speeds** that **I do know**, 

there is one speed that I like above the rest,

 without a doubt it is slow. 
 
 Because it is best. 
 
 With that off my chest I may get some rest.

***I shan't go faster henceforth.***
```python
poem = "Upon whose behest  
        was agreement gained, 
        that of all speeds put to the test,  
        the speed of fast is certainly best." 

        that the one speed chosen 
            as above the rest, 
            was Chosen incorrectly, 
            and I do protest 
            to those who claim that FASTER IS BEST!
```

I DO PROTEST TO THAT!

What then I say?

You reply, "Things will always be bad you'll always feel sad."

Or is that the idea you want me to have?

***Why are we goin faster?*** 

the number one speed,

of all of the speeds,

which speed could it be?

which speed will be chosen? 

could it be speed one or could it be three? 

or maybe speed two is the speed to be? 

If I were a speed would I still be me? 

I bet I would be if I were a three. 

the number three version of me.  

tales from the darkside through a grey forest of bare trees

a speed is a speed. indeed.

any questions? any complaints?

absorb that knowledge into your soft mushy brain.

### Who are They who say?

*"We must go faster"* 

**they** say 

But who are **they**?

why should **I** care if **they** say **things** that **way**?

I choose to go slower, my speed of choice is mine to say.

Very well, I'm going to pontificate in a most bodacious way.

### Why?

*"Why are we going faster?*
 
where? 
why? 
for whom? 

upon whose behest? 

What if I like slow speed the best?
My preference for speed is a simple request.

I like **things** in a particular **way**. 
I like them **just so**, not fast, but slow. 

and of **all** two **speeds** that **I do know**, 

there is **one speed** that I prefer above the **rest**,

 without a doubt, that speed is is slow. Because it is best. 
 
 Now, with that off my chest I may get some slow rest.

***I shan't go faster henceforth.***
```python
pontification_on_speed = 
        "Upon whose behest was a standard set, 
        that of all two speeds put to the test,  
        the speed of fast was determined best?" 

        who was granted the authority?
        By whom was this authority granted? 
        My vote was not cast, 
        this is not playing straight, 
        it is completely slanted!
        I protest! 
        Who decided fast is best? 
        For everyone here, 
        for everyone there,
        for everyone from here to Budapest
        Who is so brave to ask no request, 
        when deciding for all 
        that the one speed chosen
        as the superior speed above the rest, 
        was Chosen incorrectly, 
        and I do protest 
        to those who claim that FASTER IS BEST!
```

I DO PROTEST TO THAT!

What then I say?

You reply, "Things will always be bad you'll always feel sad."

Or is that the idea you want me to have?

***Why are we goin faster?*** 

the number one speed,

of all of the speeds,

which speed could it be?

which speed will be chosen? 

could it be speed one or could it be three? 

or maybe speed two is the speed to be? 

If I were a speed would I still be me? 

I bet I would be if I were a three. 

the number three version of me.  

tales from the darkside through a grey forest of bare trees

a speed is a speed. indeed.

any questions? any complaints?

absorb that knowledge into your soft mushy brain.

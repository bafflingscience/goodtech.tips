the command line Interface

You're here because, like me, when I started as a young whipper snapper, "What bash is?" I asked so innocently and with such wonder. I was focused intensely at the code on the screen of my favorite tv show, CSI Cyber Forensics Division. 

I would pause it, take a screenshot, Thinking to myself, 'What this is?' 

Well 28 years and three wives later, here I am, a total script master like you aint never seen before. not like this bud. you just wait. you just wait and see sancho. 

Are you fan of tutorial guides, videos, and quick tips in the form of short articles that get to the point.

# Bash ∫c®'p†

```python
# you run Python from the terminal like you know what you're doing. 
# don't pretend to be awesome at python but don't even know how to run macros in vim.
# guess who does no-how...TIMES UP....WRONG! It's ME dummy!
# I'll teach you how to run macros in vim. After I tell you what run macros in vim means. After I tell you what vim is. Then I will teach you how to change lots of things in stuff and all that in many many chapters ahead. Enjoy the journey...I know I Will!!!

# 1: Who Is Macro? And Why Is He Here?
{"@figureitoot:": "macros"}
ch = 'chapter Space' 
chff = ch + ' Part:TheFinalFrontier'
print (chff + "\nGreat job Dude!")

# output: 
# Chapter Space Part:TheFinalFrontier
# Great job Dude!
```

See how that works? Did you try it? python3.8

the esperanto of shell based scripting languages, sayin 'See ya later fellas' to zsh and bash. Fish, prepare to eat my dust cause I swim soo fast. Behold, a superior product on every level. Every device. Every platform. we out perform. We stand tall, above them all. The best shell scripting language is:

# ≤˚,yuiØgz ~ 

# ° º °~~·~~°~~·~~°~~°~~·~~°~~·~~°~~

Yes, that is exactly how to pronounce it. Great job!








Looking at the output in the screenshot above, we have two hard disks added on the test system and we will partition disk `/dev/sdb`. On mac the disk is /dev/disk0

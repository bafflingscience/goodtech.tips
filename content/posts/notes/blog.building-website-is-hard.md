### This Website Took Me Days to Build.

*A Website Built with Hugo Static-Site Generator*

# How to build a website 

## No Wordpress

Written in #markdown, #html, and #css.


This website was built built upon Version 0.80.0 of the Hugo Static Site-Generator. 

Hugo is crystal clear software that takes your markdown and turns it into pure html.  
You first will open the terminal and type: 

```bash
install Hugo` 
```

or whatever it is. 
Google it or whatever, 

On Windows, It will place the Folder at the root of your 'ThisPC/C:/Hugo'


After you create Hugo folder and all that. 
You can see how to do that here  (linkmissing).


With the current directory
'newFolder/'config.yaml'',
type `hugo -D`, 

this creates the 'public' folder, where all the content, posts, and whatever are read from by index.html, 

index.html is root of the website. Hyper Text Transfer Protocal, 
 as us brilliant geniuses call it. 

or HTTP, 

as a normie might say.

 or HTTPS, 

Which is the same with the 'S' at the end Look it up. p[could not find link - ya lazy bastard! look it up yourself! - praaaaanked !]()
follow the instructions written in Go or something. It turns it instructions written in config.yaml and creates 'index.html', which is a frickin index.   
It takes from instruction from 'config.yaml' and copies the settings into an HTML template. 






Personally, I use DuckDuckGo on a Wolf fox browser, which is built on the Firefox browser framework. 

We(me(I)) use Wolf(f|F)ox) now my dudes | dudettes. 

```powershell
We're('is.me(I'm)we"s(we.is)We're()')

doing a boycott on Firefox phase right now, 

you know how it goes;

When I was younger cooler and happier:

Leaning back in my futon, I put my converse All-Stars on the sturdy oak table. 

## The Oak Table
An absurd directory file tree, describing the aforementioned 'oak table'

Features:
- Built in my garage
- made from wood
    - bonus feature:
        - fact about wood:
        
        I felled the mighty oak myself along the foothills of the Appalachains.

        - how did you cut down the mighty oak?
        
        - i didn't stop until it was cut down
        
        - i decided to do it, 
        
            -  there fore it was to be done.

        with nothing more than a butter knife,
not even no shirt, I felled the tree and threw the trunk over my shoulder, and carried it to my garage.

## Computering the Game
Moving on, the rules are simple.
The game is success, whoever reaches it, wins.

play includes 
- time
- money
- decisions
- chaos

Success is the game you're playin', time is money, and money is time. Every single last word is important when you start writing billions of lines of code like I do every single day.

Working long into the night, even on Thursdays, after dinner with Mother.

Where are we? In the realm of the computers of course. 

Computering is all about making difficult things easier. It's a dance with the machine. When you dance, is faster better? Not always my dear fellow.

This is not a guarantee of anything worth reading, but will negotiate upon having completed your contribution pledge, and we thank you so much for supporting all that we do, thank you to all the people who are sad, or not happy, to those people, I say I love you and I am sad too. 

But being sad ain't so bad. There are definitely worse feelings I've had, more so for sure than being sad, so I guess you could say it ain't so bad being sad.

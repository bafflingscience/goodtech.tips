With DuckDuckGo default address bar search, you can prepend with

### [AdBlocker for YouTube](https://mybrowseraddon.com/adblocker-for-youtube.htm)

AdBlocker for YouTube™ removes all annoying ads from YouTube.

### [ClearURLs](https://gitlab.com/KevinRoebert/ClearUrls)
    
This extension will automatically remove tracking elements from URLs to help protect your privacy when browsing through the Internet.

 Many websites use tracking elements in the URL, e.g. 
 https://example.com?utm_source=newsletter1&utm_medium=emailutm_campaign=sale to mark your online activity. All that tracking code is not necessary for a website to be displayed or work correctly and can therefore be removed—that is exactly what ClearURLs does.

 Another common example are Amazon URLs. If you search for a product on Amazon you will see a very long URL, such as: 
    
https://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct/ref=sxin_0_pb?__mk_de=aMazon&keywords=tea&pd_rd_i=exampleProduct&pd_rd_r=8d39e4cd-1e4f-43db-b6e7-72e969a84aa5&pd_rd_w=1pcKM&pd_rd_wg=hYrNl&pf_rd_p=50bbfd25-5ef7-41a2-68d6-74d854b30e30&pf_rd_r=0GMWD0YYKA7XFGX55ADP&qid=1517757263&rnid=2914120011


Most of the above URL is tracking code. 
Once ClearURLs has cleaned the address, it will look like this:
    
https://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct

Why use this extension as opposed to similar ones?
Most other “link cleaners” employ about a dozen rules when looking for tracking parameters  to remove. ClearURLs utilizes over 250 rules, so its capabilities are more comprehensive.
And ClearURLs is open source, so everyone can join in to the project and/or can check the   source code to error or malicious code.
All functions in a nutshell
Removes tracking from URLs automatically in the background
Blocks some common ad domains (optional)
Has a built-in tool to clean up multiple URLs at once
Supports redirection to the destination, without tracking services as middleman
Adds an entry to the context menu so that links can be copied quickly and cleanly
Blocks hyperlink auditing, also known as ping tracking
Prevents ETag tracking
Prevents tracking injection over history API
Prevents Google from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)
Prevents Yandex from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)

### [DarkReader](https://darkreader.org/)

This eye-care extension enables night mode creating dark themes for websites on the fly. Dark Reader inverts bright colors making them high contrast and easy to read at night.

You can adjust brightness, contrast, sepia filter, dark mode, font settings and ignore-list.

Dark Reader doesn't show ads and doesn't send user's data anywhere. It is fully open-source.

### [DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials](https://duckduckgo.com/app)

Privacy, simplified.

Tired of being tracked online? We can help. At DuckDuckGo, we believe online privacy should be simple.

DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials comes packed with best-in-class privacy essentials and makes browsing in Firefox even faster.

Escape Online Tracking — automatically block hidden third-party trackers we can find lurking on websites you visit, which stops the companies behind those trackers from collecting and selling your data.
Search Privately — our private search engine comes built-in so you can search the Internet without being tracked.
Enforce Encryption — force sites to use an encrypted (HTTPS) connection where available, protecting your data from prying eyes, like from unwanted snoopers and Internet service providers.
Decode Privacy — each site you visit gets a Privacy Grade (A-F) so you can see how protected you are at a glance, and you can even dig into the details to see who we caught trying to track you.

### [FireFox Relay](https://mozilla.com)

We all make many online accounts, but most of them are linked to just one or two email addresses. This means if just one account is hacked, every account using the same email address is also at risk.

Firefox Relay helps you protect your real email address - the one most closely tied to your online identity. It lets you generate unique, random aliases you can use to sign up for accounts, apps, or newsletters, and forwards messages to your real address. If you find that an account is sending unwanted email or spam, you can block the alias and it will stop sending email to your inbox. Once you no longer want an account, you can delete the alias.

### [OneTab](http://www.one-tab.com)

Whenever you find yourself with too many tabs, click the OneTab icon to convert all of your tabs into a list. When you need to access the tabs again, you can either restore them individually or all at once.

When your tabs are in the OneTab list, you will save memory and CPU utilization because you will have reduced the number of tabs open in your browser.

Privacy assurance

Information about your tabs are never transmitted or disclosed to either the OneTab developers or any other party. The only exception to this is if you intentionally click on our 'share as a web page' feature that allows you to upload your list of tabs into a web page in order to share them with others. Tabs are never shared unless you specifically use the 'share as a web page' button. We use Google's favicon generator to retrieve favicons for each domain in your list, but only the domain name is used and the full URL is never disclosed.

Additional Benefits

Depending on how many scripts are running inside your tabs, moving them to OneTab can also speed up your computer by reducing the CPU load. We have also had reports that this also contributes to your computer resuming from sleep more quickly.

FAQ: Why do I need OneTab, when I can just use my browser history?
A: Your browser history contains every site you've ever visited. OneTab is typically used to store just the smaller selection of open tabs you are not finished with yet - such as when you are mid way through researching a topic.

FAQ: Why do I need OneTab, when I can just use the "bookmark all tabs" browser feature?
A: OneTab is the quickest way, with only one click, to store all of your open tabs into a list. Once they are in your list, OneTab makes it much easier to scan over, delete, label and manage your list of saved tabs. There are also plenty of special options and features, such as the ability to exclude certain web sites, to remove duplicates, and to export/import tabs.

### [Bypass Paywalls Clean](https://gitlab.com/magnolia1234/bypass-paywalls-firefox-clean)


Add-on allows you to read articles from websites that implement a paywall.

Not everyone is able to afford multiple subscriptions on many different news sites, especially when they just want to read a single article (from Twitter) without being enrolled in a montly/yearly membership.

Notice: if you use this add-on regularly on the same website, please consider paying a subscription for it. Don't forget that free press can't be sustainable without funding.

### [Forget Me Not](https://github.com/Lusito/forget-me-not/) Forget Cookies & Other Data

This web-extension deletes data websites store in the browser in the following situations:

When all instances of a website have been left:
Cookies
Local-Storage (Firefox 58+ only)
History & Downloads
This can be delayed in seconds
Different cleanup types can be applied (see the help page within the add-on for a more detailed description)
Never: No cleaning.

On Leave: Clean on domain leave and on browser start.
Instantly: Prevent data from being set, if possible. Otherwise behave like On Leave.

History

This can be delayed in seconds
Rules still apply
Manually clean the above

### [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere)

Many sites on the web offer some limited support for encryption over HTTPS, but make it difficult to use. For instance, they may default to unencrypted HTTP, or fill encrypted pages with links that go back to the unencrypted site.

The HTTPS Everywhere extension fixes these problems by rewriting all requests to these sites to HTTPS.

### [Multi-Account Containers](https://github.com/mozilla/multi-account-containers#readme)

The Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension lets you carve out a separate box for each of your online lives – no more opening a different browser just to check your work email! Here is a quick video showing you how it works.

Under the hood, it separates website storage into tab-specific Containers. Cookies downloaded by one Container are not available to other Containers. With the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension, you can...

Sign in to two different accounts on the same site (for example, you could sign in to work email and home email in two different Container tabs.
Keep different kinds of browsing far away from each other (for example, you might use one Container tab for managing your Checking Account and a different Container tab for searching for new songs by your favorite band)
Avoid leaving social-network footprints all over the web (for example, you could use a Container tab for signing in to a social network, and use a different tab for visiting online news sites, keeping your social identity separate from tracking scripts on news sites)


After installing the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension, click the Containers icon to edit your Containers. Change their colors, names, and icons. Long-click the new tab button to open a new Container tab.

Privacy in Firefox Multi-Account Containers

The Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension does not send any information to Mozilla.

How does this compare to the Facebook Container extension?
Facebook Container specifically isolates Facebook and works automatically. The Firefox Multi-Account Containers is a more general extension that allows you to create containers and determine which sites open in each container. This extension can be customized to suit your needs for multiple sites and multiple logins, but takes more time to set up than Facebook Container.

You can use Multi-Account Containers to create a container for Facebook and assign facebook.com to it. Multi-Account Containers will then make sure to only open facebook.com in the Facebook Container. However, unlike Facebook Container, Multi-Account Containers doesn’t prevent you from opening non-Facebook sites in your Facebook Container. So users of Multi-Account Containers need to take a bit extra care to make sure they leave the Facebook Container when navigating to other sites. In addition, Facebook Container assigns some Facebook-owned sites like Instagram and Messenger to the Facebook Container. With Multi-Account Containers, you will have to assign these in addition to facebook.com.

Facebook Container also deletes Facebook cookies from your other containers on install and when you restart the browser, to clean up any potential Facebook trackers. Multi-Account Containers does not do that for you.

Can I use both Multi-Account Containers and Facebook Container?
Yes, but you need to be a little careful. Don't use Multi-Account Container to assign facebook.com to a Container, and then try installing Facebook Container. If you a Multi-Account Containers user and want to use both addons, unassign facebook.com, messenger.com, and instagram.com first, then install Facebook Container.

### [uBlock Origin]()

### [Decentralytes](https://decentraleyes.org)

Websites have increasingly begun to rely much more on large third-parties for content delivery. Canceling requests for ads or trackers is usually without issue, however blocking actual content, not unexpectedly, breaks pages. The aim of this add-on is to cut out the middleman by providing lightning speed delivery of local (bundled) files to improve online privacy.

• Protects privacy by evading large delivery networks that claim to offer free services.
• Complements regular blockers such as uBlock Origin (recommended), Adblock Plus, et al.
• Works directly out of the box; absolutely no prior configuration required.

Note: Decentraleyes is no silver bullet, but it does prevent a lot of websites from making you send these kinds of requests. Ultimately, you can make Decentraleyes block requests for any missing CDN resources, too.

### [DownThemAll](https://downthemall.org/)


DownThemAll will help you select, queue, sort and run your downloads faster. It comes with advanced ways to select what links to download, and will remember your previous decisions so that you can queue more downloads with just OneClick!

Advanced users will also like using renaming masks, which let you automatically assign names (and even sub-folders within your downloads folder), fast-filtering or even custom, re-usable filters.

DownThemAll is open-source and free. We spend a lot of time making it, and keep spending a lot of time improving it, and even fixing some problems in Firefox itself so DownThemAll! can work even better.
We will never add adware, spyware, user tracking or other nasty stuff. Therefore we rely on your donations exclusively to fund the development.

We are looking for people willing to help translate DownThemAll! to more languages. For a small guide on how to do that, please see our preliminary translation guide. You will get our gratitude, and the gratitude of all the users whose live you improved by bringing DownThemAll! to their language.
